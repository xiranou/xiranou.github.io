      With the advancement of the Internet and web applications, you are now able to do many things on the web. Many of those things involves you to put your personal information on the web, such as your credit card number when ordering meal deliveries, or even your bank information when paying that credit card online.

      These actions usually requires you to set up an account with a password, but will that ever be enough to stop the Internet thieves?

      Think back a couple of years ago, if you are asked to set up a password the only requirement maybe that it is all in digits, or do not excess 8 characters. Then it becomes 8 characters long and has to mix digits with characters. Nowadays, many sites and applications requires you (yes, REQUIRES!), to have a password that is at least have 8 characters, mix with digits, letters, and the ever-loving symbols. Yes, symbols. I used to be able to type my password with one hand, fast and easy to remember. However, does this complexity in  password really makes our personal information safer on the Web?

      There are countless of malware programs out there lurking for you to make the mistake and invite them home. Once they do, no matter how complicated or clever your password are, they will get theirs hands (or claws, tentacles) on it. Not to mention the recent Heartbleed bug, passwords are not nearly enough to keep your information safe.

      I believe it is time we call for an upgrade in password security. It won't stop something like Heartbleed, but it's a good start to harden key that could unlock all your secret. Maybe that our fingerprint scan or eyeball scan to need to step up to the plate and become our access key to personal informations.
