      These would be the values that are important to me and its respective scores on how I would try to live up to them. There are quite a lot of them and I'm sure that there are quite a few more that's not on the list. I can't remember the topic of the last time someone asked me for advice. I do remember the feeling when being asked and after given out my advice. I always felt respected when someone comes to me for advice on any topic. I'm not good at giving advice, but I like the chance on having a discussion with someone on a topic they care about and that I happen to have some experience in. I find that I will always learn something by the end.

      Of all those values, I think that commitment, control, self-knowledge, freedom and will-power are the most important to me. They all compliment each other, and they all begins with control and self-knowledge. I aim to have control, to have a deep knowledge about myself. Staying in control will help me build up the will-power to dig deeper within myself, to honor my commitments. I believe that the only way to achieve personal freedom is to have a vast knowledge about oneself. You can never be happy, or sad, or any emotion at all if you don't know what, why, and how you feel. You will be shackled by your own mind and get frustrated at the false sense of self who is abandoning your own freedom.

      Being rid of freedom frightens me. To a point where I think that without the freedom of being oneself is to cease its own existence. We are all suffering until the day we have a deep enough understanding of ourselves. Then you will have true control over yourself, the true freedom to break away from your shackles and embrace your very own existence.

      These shackles comes from different places. Stereotype threat is one of these shackles. Being aware of that, we should never let ourselves being chained by these meaningless bonds and giving up our own existence.

      "I think, therefor I exists."
