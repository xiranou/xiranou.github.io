        <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target='_blank'>YouTube</a>

        When you go to the YouTube homepage your eyes are bound to be drawn to all the thumbnails of videos there. It's very effective on inviting people to click on one of those videos and start binge watching. It is very easy to navigate through the site as its layout is simple and clear. It also generates a very nice list of recommended videos right next to your current one, and it usually have some good recommendations. Although YouTube is mainly for entertainments, you can also find a lot of informative and educational videos too. I personally find video tutorials to be one of my favorites.

        <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/" target='_blank'>Twitch</a>

        Twitch is a video steaming website that is getting more and more popular. A lot of different steams are on this site but I do find it's hard to narrow them down to what I want to find. It also feels hard to find a specific channel without its direct link, unless it's a channel that is being heavily promoted. For a website that hosts this many streams, the site itself looks very clean and it's easy to navigate. Although most of its contents are entertainments, they can still be very diverse since they are created by the streamers themselves.

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org" target='_blank'>Wikipedia</a>

        I do believe almost everyone with internet at least vists Wikipedia once or twice per day, or maybe even more. I visit Wikipedia whenever something new comes up, or just want to find out more about a subject.Its large database has information on pretty much anything you can think of. It is a very effective way to find introductory information to anything you want to know. It has a very clean and organized layout, it takes you straight to what you want to find. It also has links to other subjects' wiki page whenever it pops up on your current page. It also has a very organized references list at the bottom for anyone who wants to do more research on the subject matter.
