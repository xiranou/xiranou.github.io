        Right after I got accepted to DBC, I immediately fell into the consumer mindset: will I get what I pay for? After watching the video, and learning the philosophy behind the kitchen/cook mindset, I feel that I'm looking forward to embrace the latter. Even though it's a lot more easier to follow the consumer mindset, and maybe even feel more comfortable in doing so, but when given the opportunity to take charge, to make changes, to inspire or be inspired seems very exciting and mind-blowing. I guess that's what DBC had drawn my attention in the first place, but I've never been able to figure it out quite well. I'm very disappointed by the current education system, and maybe even suffered from it, and what DBC offers are completely opposite of that. I know that I will need to step out of my comfort zone, but I think I'm less afraid of it now knowing what kind of mindset I should adopt.

        It is very comforting to hear Shereef say that DBC acknowledges the fears and uncertainties that I currently have. The fear of failure haunts me the most, can I really learn to be a developer? With the philosophy of the kitchen mindset, I think I will gain a lot by adjusting myself to embrace this 'madness'. I'm also very excited to see what else does DBC have to offer, and take in as much as I can from this experience.
