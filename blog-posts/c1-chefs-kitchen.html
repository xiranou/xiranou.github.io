        <!-- consumer mindset = want to get what is paid for
        kitchen mindset = in it together, work for it together. a sense of ownership, in creator mode. Make it amazing for me and cohort.
        take control of your own education
        fear of an importer, walk in thinking you are not good enough.
        fear of an superior
        dbc acknowledges both fears, made me feel good about this madness.
        changing curriculum
        competition vs supportive
        having a bad day with the team -->

        Right after I got accepted to DBC, I immediately fell into the consumer mindset: will I get what I pay for? After watching the video, and learning the philosophy behind the kitchen/cook mindset, I feel that I looking forward to embrace the latter. Even though it is way easier to fall into the consumer mindset, maybe even feel more comfortable in doing so, but when given the opportunity to take charge, to make changes, to inspire or be inspired sounds very exciting and mind-blowing. I guess that's what DBC had drawn my attention in the first place, but I've never been able to quite figure it out. I'm very disappointed by the current education system, and maybe even suffered from it, and what DBC offers are completely opposite of that. I know that I will need to step out of my comfort zone, but I think I'm less afraid of it now that I know what kind of mindset I should adopt.

        It is very comforting to hear Shereef say that DBC acknowledges the fears and uncertainties that I currently have. With the philosophy of kitchen mindset, I think I will survive DBC. I'm also very excited to see what else DBC has to offer, and gain as much as I can from this mad experience.
