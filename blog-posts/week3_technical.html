      JavaScript started as language for the Netscape Navigator browser in 1995. It has since been adopted to every web browsers today. Although primarily being deployed as a scripting language for the World Wide Web, JavaScript is a fully functional programming language. It is very easy to learn and there are many other technologies, beyond web developing, that can be integrated alongside JavaScript.

      While it is powerful and complicated, but what makes JavaScript so popular is mainly due to the fact that it is support by every web browsers out there today. While HTML lays out the skeleton for a web page and CSS puts down the styling rules for its graphical display, JavaScript adds interactivity to it. It is also the only free, cross-platform, client-side programming language that is universally adopted.

      With JavaScript, it is easy for a user to enter data onto a web page and see the result.Think of every intractable applications on a web page. They are all made possible thanks to JavaScript. For example, it has the ability to catch both mouse and keyboard inputs.
      The ability to interact with an web application with a few clicks of your mouse or some keystroke from your keyboard is given by the use of JavaScript. It can catch those events from your mouse and keyboard and allow developers create amazing things with it.

      JavaScript is powerful and complicated, and yet, like any other programming languages, it has it's limitations and flaws. One major limitation is that it cannot access anything outside the web page itself. This is done for the reason of security that web pages can't install files onto your computer, but it also means that you can't use JavaScript to read or write files. One of the flaws comes from it being cross-platform. Different browsers interpret JavaScript differently. This may let to inconsistencies in applications across platforms. Another flaw comes from the idea to make JavaScript easy for beginners to learn, it is very liberal in what it allows. For example, you could perform a arithmetic operation on a null value and an integer. They system will not point out this error since JavaScript allows such operation and it will make catching errors difficult. JavaScript also has type coercion which it evaluates of two operand of different types and change one operand to a type that it deems "equivalent" to the other. The outcome of such operation in JavaScript isn't always what you expect and can be error-prone.
