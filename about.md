I'm passionate about solving challenging problems, I enjoy the sense of accomplishment when implementing effective solutions and gaining a great deal of knowledge along the way. I take great joy in learning better practices, crafting elegant and maintainable code. I'm also passionate about learning and understanding new technologies, as I'm always curious at the power and limitations of different languages and frameworks.

I'm highly focused and motivated, which allows me to be a proficient learner to new languages and frameworks. I care about having a good relationships with the people I work with as I enjoy learning from others and would love to help with the best of my abilities whenever possible.

I'm enticed by the magical spells of programming and aim to become a grand magus of these spells. I would love to work with people who share the same passion.
