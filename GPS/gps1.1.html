            <h3>What is pair programming?</h3>
            <p>Teaming up with another programmer on the same project. One would be a navigator who will give instructions
                while the other would be the driver who writes the code. Navigator and driver will be in continuous communication
                with each other.

            <h3>Why is it important to DBC?</h3>
            <p>This is important, because most programmers will work in groups. It is important to learn and practice how to communicate with our partners. It will also help programmers learn from each other. It makes it easier to work out ideas towards solutions without getting sidetracked. It also helps with error checking.</p>

            <h3>Driver and Navigator</h3>
            <p>The driver will write the code as directed by the navigator. They will communicate, but the navigator has the direction in sight.</p>

        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>This is the first guided pairing sessions that we both had, although we agreed on a driver and navigator role we were both eager to be the driver.
            Pair programming allows us to stay focused, and we were able to dive deeper into the challenge more efficiently.
            Reaching a solution is easier when communicating with a partner. We both enjoyed the pairing session. This pairing session worked great for us, we got the chance to communicate. Driving and navigating went well most of the time and when we stumbled, we were aware of it and corrected the situation. This is a good learning experience.
