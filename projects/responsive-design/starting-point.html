    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>In this challenge, I've learned a great deal about fluid layout and responsive designs. I've come to an understanding the advantages of using fluid layout as opposite to using static pixel dimensions. This can greatly improve the user experience on a site. It is frustrating to see the webpage go haywire because the browser dimensions changes. If using fluid layout to style webpage layouts, the webpage will adjust itself smoothly across all dimensions. However, just using fluid layout is not enough. You don't want to see your navigation bar get squished so small that it can't be seen by the human eyes. Implementing different layout changes to specific browser dimensions with media query would solve that problem perfectly.

    After experimenting with my pair on this challenge, we are becoming very familiar to using both techniques to good effects. I've learned to use Chrome Dev Tools to find out which width I should set my media query, and I find that moving around to have the visual of it is the best way for me. There are quite a lot of new skills to be picked up, so a lot more practice and experimenting needs to be done, and I'm confident that I'll pick up and discover more during that process. It is all very exciting and I've enjoyed doing this challenge.</p>
