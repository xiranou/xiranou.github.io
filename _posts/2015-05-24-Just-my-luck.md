Setbacks and unforunate events...

It comes a time that you want to curse your luck and the gods if there are any...

A thing I've often done in the past...A thing I've tried hard to push away...

It's not worth the trouble to curse them as luck is mischievous and the gods...Well...

There are things that neither luck or gods will give you: your strength and will.

Take a deep breath and regain your strength and will...

For the fight still lies ahead.
