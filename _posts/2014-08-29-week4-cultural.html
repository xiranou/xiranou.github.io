      With the advancement of the Internet and web applications, you are now able to do many things on the web. Many of those things involves you to put your personal information on the web, such as your credit card number when ordering on Amazon, or even your bank information when paying that credit card online.

      These actions usually require you to set up an account with a password, but will that ever be enough to stop the Internet thieves?

      Think back a couple of years ago, if you are asked to set up a password the only requirement to it maybe is to only use digits, or do not excess 8 characters. Then it became to 8 characters long minimum and has to mix digits with characters. Today, many sites and applications requires you (yes, REQUIRES!), to have a password that is at least have 8 characters, mix with digits, upper and lowercase letters, and the not-so-easy-to-remember symbols. Yes, symbols. However, does the required complexity in password really makes our personal information safer on the Web?

      There are countless of malware programs out there lurking for you to make the mistake and invite them home. Once they do, no matter how complicated or clever your password may be, they will get theirs hands (or claws, or tentacles) on it. Not to mention the recent Heartbleed bug, passwords are not nearly enough to keep your information safe.

      For password alone, I believe it is time we call for an upgrade. It won't stop something like Heartbleed, but it's a good start to harden key that could unlock all your secrets. Our fingerprints scan need to step up to the plate and becomes the keys to secure our personal information on the Web.
