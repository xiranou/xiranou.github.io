1. Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?

I remembered the time I had an emotional conflict was when I told my father that I wanted to quit my job. I had no interest in that job and it was very stressful that I was suffering from anxiety attacks at night. When my dad asked about my job I told him my decision.

2. What was the source of the conflict?

He responded with a disappointing look and said 'All jobs are the same.' What pushed me to anger was the fact that he doesn't even want to know how much that job had taken its toll on me. He began with 'All jobs are the same' instead of 'Why'.

3. How did you handle that conflict?

I was infuriated all of the sudden. I had never in my life felt this angry. Sure, I can rant about the crappy ending of Mass Effect 3, but that was about as far as I can go. But not this time. I even scared myself. For a guy who born with a soft voice and doesn't even like to speak up, I was loud. I told him why, loudly, then I constrained myself and walked away. I didn't want to go on. This anger scares me too much to go on, I had to calm down. I spent the next few hours gathering my thoughts and to regain control. This is the first time I've lost control. I really thought I had it under control.

4. Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?

I believe I had made it worse. I could've constrained myself earlier and end it peacefully. Then explain myself better when my emotion is in check.

5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?

I would've said nothing that night. I would've talk to him the day after. To truly explain myself and ask for his advices. It would've been much easier.

6. What did you learn from this experience?

To develop a better control of my emotions. At the time we spoke, my dad thought I was quitting a perfectly fine job, he immediately jump to a conclusion for me without anything from me. As soon as he learned about my job he was supportive of me. That night of me losing to anger was extremely pointless. I hate pointless and losing control. Getting angry does both.
